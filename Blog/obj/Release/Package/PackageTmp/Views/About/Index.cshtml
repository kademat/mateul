                My name is <strong>Mateusz</strong>. I'm @mineAge years old. I am a graduate of the Gdańsk University of Technology. I finished my master theory on
                Department of Algorithms and System Modelling on a faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics. One of mine favourite quotes is:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.</p>
                <footer>Paulo Coelho, <cite>The Alchemist</cite></footer>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                This is the reason why I decided to create this website, even if it could be a failure :)

                I like teaching. When I was .NET Web Developer as freelander I was also a programming teacher in highest class in a high school.
                Now I'm working as .NET programmer. Currently I have 4 Microsoft certifications
                (you can click at the number you will get new page with additional informations about the exam e.g. measured skills):

                I also like sport - especially gym and running :) It is a symbol for me that means we don't give up when we are having hard moments.
                I think that in running there are no losers - losers stayed at home. I started running when I was 10. In next 8 years I started in about 150
                running competitions. Nowadays I'm running, because I still like it and it makes me happy ;)
                I also like others activity like squash, bowling, sometimes football... It's hard for me to find a sport that I don't like ;p

            </p>
            <p>
                Except sport and programming I like also reading books and work with resolving the logic tasks (sometimes I create them :) ). Since @mensaYears
                years I'm a member of polish Mensa ("Membership of Mensa is open to persons who have attained a score within the upper two percent of the
                general population on an approved intelligence test that has been properly administered and supervised.").
