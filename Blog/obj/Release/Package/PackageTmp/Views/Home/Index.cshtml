            This page is about my passion - programming. I decided to make this page because I wanted to share my knowledge and passion with other people. 
            I hope that this page will be helpful not only for programmers but also for everyone who want to become more efficient in her/his job :)
        </p>
        <p>
            The commont question was about why I've choosen this website name. The answer is simple - Mateul is my nickname choosen by my friend :)
            I thought that it will be simple to remember.
        </p>

            In next sections you can find a short description of the page.

        <div class="wow bounceInLeft animated" data-wow-delay="0.5s" data-wow-duration="1s">

            <p>
                This is the main section of this web page. You can find here a lot of tutorials some of them are connected with how to be
                more efficient in our jobs, user interface and ASP.NET.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside this section you will be able to find a lot of code examples with screenshoots showing the result of the code when
                it's possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                I decided to use special form of user console input (e.g. in GIT), because it look similar to the console code. For example:
            </p>
            <p>
                <kbd>This is an example of expected user console input</kbd>
            </p>
            <p>
                For the code examples with JavaScript, HTML, CSS I will be using the jsfiddle, where you will be able to find code and see the result of the code:

                <iframe class="code" width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/7z02a8cj/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            </p>
            <p>
                When I will be describing the code examples it looks like below:
            </p>
            <p>
                For <b>javaScript</b> files:

                <pre class="brush: js">
                    document.write("This is example of js code!")
                </pre>
                For <b>C#</b> files:
                <pre class="brush: csharp">
                    // Matik.cs
                    public class Matik
                    {
                       public static void Main()
                       {
                          System.Console.WriteLine("This is example of C# code!");
                       }
                    }
                </pre>
                For <b>css</b> files:
                <pre class="brush: css">
                     .matik {
                        background-color: white;
                    }
                </pre>
                <!-- Finally, to actually run the highlighter, you need to include this JS on your page -->
                <script type="text/javascript">
                    SyntaxHighlighter.all()
                </script>
            </p>
            <p>
                I think that for now is everything :)
