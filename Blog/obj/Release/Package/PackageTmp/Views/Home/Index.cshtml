<h1>Welcome on just simple typing code website!</h1>

<!-- Main description -->
<section>
    <p>
        This website is about my coding passion. I decided to make this page to show essential product of programming - code :)
    </p>
    <p>
        At this page you will find as name - "<b>J</b>ust <b>S</b>imple <b>T</b>yping <b>CODE</b>" says -
        a lot of <b>programming code</b> with comments and results. Also you will be able to find <b>working examples</b> - results of typing code.
    </p>
    <p>
        I want to encourage you to use mine code and leave comments. It's totally free! Maybe you also want to put something inside?
        Don't hesitate to contact me! You can find contact details on ABOUT ME page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is short description of the code structure that you are able to find on this webpage:

<!-- Examples -->
<section>
    <h3 class="wow bounceInRight animated" data-wow-duration="1s">Examples</h3>
    <div class="wow bounceInLeft animated" data-wow-delay="0.5s" data-wow-duration="1s">
        <img src="../../images/home/runningPrograms.png" id="programmingRunning" class="media-object img-thumbnail margin-left-default float-right" width="200" alt="Programs" />
        <p>
            At the beginning of the coding examples you can find examples if possible. Just to know what you're going to achieve. For example
            if you want to create a simple form where you will be able to put information about your name and birthsday's date you will see
            a working example. My aim is to allow you to test it, see if it suits you and play a little bit.
        </p>
        <p>
            But as you might know:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>
            So feel free to report bugs that you find on my page (in comments or via email), I will try to remove them as soon as possible ;)

<section>
    <h3 class="wow bounceInRight animated" data-wow-duration="1s">Programming codes</h3>
    <div class="wow bounceInLeft animated" data-wow-delay="0.5s" data-wow-duration="1s">
        <img src="../../images/home/code.png" class="media-object img-thumbnail margin-left-default float-right" width="200" alt="Code" />
        <p>
            Below the examples you can find a core of this webpage - a lot of code - ASP.NET, user interface (HTML and JavaScript) and
            databases. I was trying to find nice syntax highlighter which displays line numbers, but when you want to copy the code
            you will not copy the line numbers - so you are able to use the code without changes.
        </p>
        <h4>Code structure</h4>
        <p>
            I decided to use special form of code for user console input (for example in command line):
        </p>
        <p>
            <kbd>C:\Users\YourUser>ping jstcode.com</kbd>
        </p>
        <p>
            Want to try? You do not have to use your mouse, just type about 20 characters!
            So in Windows you can type together <kbd>Windows key + R</kbd> then type <kbd>cmd</kbd> and after hitting an enter you can type
            <kbd>ping jstcode.com</kbd> and enter and you can see the effect :)
        </p>

        <p>
            The code on my page looks like this:
        </p>
        <p>
            For <b>JavaScript</b> files:

            <pre class="brush: js">
                    document.write("This is example of js code from jscode.com!")
                </pre>

            For <b>C#</b> files:
            <pre class="brush: csharp">
                    // Jscode.cs
                    public class Jscode
                    {
                       public static void Main()
                       {
                          System.Console.WriteLine("This is example of C# code from jstcode.com!");
                       }
                    }
                </pre>
            For <b>css</b> files:
            <pre class="brush: css">
                     .jstcode {
                        background-color: white;
                    }
                </pre>
            <!-- Finally, to actually run the highlighter, you need to include this JS on your page -->
            <script type="text/javascript">
                SyntaxHighlighter.all()
            </script>
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't forget that the most important thing is to do some exercises with the code! So for code examples
            connected with JavaScript, HTML and CSS I'm using the <b>JSFiddle</b>. It's a great tool - you can see the effect of the code and
            you can even click on the button it the top right corner and make changes - then you see the immediate result.
            It shows <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>! Check it out:
            <iframe src="//jsfiddle.net/85rc22rn/embedded/result,html,js,css" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="code"></iframe>
            At the beginning you can see Result, but by clicking on HTML, JavaScript or CSS you can look at the code behind.
            </p>
