<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<article>
    <p>
        This page is about my 2 biggest passions - programming and running. I decided to make this page because I like
        creating web pages where I can share with other people with my knowledge and passion - maybe someone else start
        programming or running? I think that would be great!
    </p>
    <p>
        Below you can find a short description on what is in the page.

        <p>
            This is the main section of this web page. You can find here a lot of tutorials (or you will find a lot of them in near
            future ;)).
        </p>
        <p>
            Inside this section you will be able to find a lot of code examples with screen showing the result of the code when
            it's possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided to use special form of user console input (e.g. in GIT), because it look similar to the console code. For
            example:
        </p>
        <p>
            <kbd>This is an example of expected user console input</kbd>
        </p>
        <p>
            When I use code examples it looks like below:
        </p>
        <p>
            <pre>&lt;p&gt;Sample of the code here...&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            I think that for now is everything :)

            This section is about running. It contains description how to start, some trening plans and reports from my running
            competitions. On this subpage there is disqus enabled, so you can comment, give advices, your opinions e.t.c.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think that my favourite quote about running is a great summary of why I created this subpage:
        </p>
        <p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>I run because if I didn't, I'd be sluggish and glum and spend too much time on the couch. I run to breathe the fresh air. I run to explore. I run to escape the ordinary. I run... to savor the trip along the way. Life becomes a little more vibrant, a little more intense. I like that.</p>
