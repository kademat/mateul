            This page is about my two biggest passions: programming and running. I decided to make this page
            because I wanted to share with my knowledge and passion with other people. I hope that this page will be
            helpful not only for advanced programmers, but it wold be helpful for everyone who want to become more efficient
            in their job and also for everyone who want to be healthier and feel better.

            The commont question was about why I've choosen this website name. The answer is simple - Mateul is my
            nickname choosen recently by my friend :) I thought that it will be simple to remember.

            In next sections there is a short description on what is in the page.

            <p>
                This is the main section of this web page. You can find here a lot of programming tutorials - also connected with how to be
                more efficient programmer. The main topics of tutorials are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Efficient programmer</li>
                    <li>GIT course</li>
                    <li>UI tricks</li>
                    <li>ASP.NET MVC course</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside this section you will be able to find a lot of code examples with screenshoots showing the result of the code when
                it's possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                I decided to use special form of user console input (e.g. in GIT), because it look similar to the console code. For
                example:
            </p>
            <p>
                <kbd>This is an example of expected user console input</kbd>
            </p>
            <p>
                When I use code examples it looks like below:
            </p>
            <p>
                For <b>javaScript</b> files:

                <pre class="brush: js">
                    document.write("This is example of js code!")
                </pre>
                For <b>C#</b> files:
                <pre class="brush: csharp">
                    // Matik.cs
                    public class Matik
                    {
                       public static void Main()
                       {
                          System.Console.WriteLine("This is example of C# code!");
                       }
                    }
                </pre>
                For <b>css</b> files:
                <pre class="brush: css">
                     .matik {
                        background-color: white;
                    }
                </pre>
                <!-- Finally, to actually run the highlighter, you need to include this JS on your page -->
                <script type="text/javascript">
                    SyntaxHighlighter.all()
                </script>
            </p>
            <p>
                I think that for now is everything :)

                This section is about running. It contains description how to start, some trening plans and reports from my running
                competitions. On this subpage there is disqus enabled, so you can comment, give advices, your opinions e.t.c.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think that my favourite quote about running is a great summary of why I created this subpage:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>I run because if I didn't, I'd be sluggish and glum and spend too much time on the couch. I run to breathe the fresh air. I run to explore. I run to escape the ordinary. I run... to savor the trip along the way. Life becomes a little more vibrant, a little more intense. I like that.</p>
