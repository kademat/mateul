<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<article>
    <p>
        This page is about my 2 biggest passions - programming and running. I decided to make this page because I like
        creating web pages where I can share with other people with my knowledge and passion - maybe someone else start
        programming or running? It would be great!
    </p>
    <p>
        Below you can find a short description on what is in the page:

        <h4>Tutorials</h4>
        <img src="~/images/code.png" class="media-object img-thumbnail margin-left-default" width="200" align="right" />
        <p>
            This is the main section of this web page. You can find here a lot of tutorials (or you will find a lot of them in near future ;)).
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided to use there inline source code, that look like: <code>Example of inline source code.</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I use examples of user's console input e.g. in GIT I decided to use there:
        </p>
        <p>
            <kbd>cd</kbd>
        </p>
        <p>
            When I use code examples it look like below:
        </p>
        <p>
            <pre>&lt;p&gt;Sample text here...&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
        </p>
        <p>I think that for now is everything :)</p>

            My favourite quote about running:
        </p>
        <p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>I run because if I didn’t, I’d be sluggish and glum and spend too much time on the couch. I run to breathe the fresh air. I run to explore. I run to escape the ordinary. I run…to savor the trip along the way. Life becomes a little more vibrant, a little more intense. I like that.</p>
