            This website is about my programming passion. I decided to make this page to show essential product of programming - code :)
        </p>
        <p>
            At this page you will find as name - "<b>j</b>ust <b>s</b>imple <b>t</b>yping <b>code</b>" says -
            a lot of <b>programming code</b> with comments and results. Also you will be able to find <b>working examples</b> - results of typing code.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to encourage you to use mine code and leave comments. It's totally free! Maybe you also want to put something inside?
            Don't hesitate to contact me! You can find contact details on ABOUT ME page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is short description of what you will be able to find on this webpage:

        <h3 class="wow bounceInRight animated" data-wow-duration="1s">CODES</h3>
        <div class="wow bounceInLeft animated" data-wow-delay="0.5s" data-wow-duration="1s">
            <img src="../../images/home/code.png" class="media-object img-thumbnail margin-left-default" width="200" align="right" alt="Code"/>
            <p>
                This is the main section of this web page. You can find here a lot of code, some of them are connected with user interface, JavaScript
                or ASP.NET.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside this section you will be able to find a lot of code examples with screenshoots showing the result of the code when
                it's possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                I decided to use special form of user console input (e.g. in GIT), because it look similar to the console code. For example:
            </p>
            <p>
                <kbd>This is an example of expected user console input</kbd>
            </p>
            <p>
                For the code examples with JavaScript, HTML, CSS I will be using the jsfiddle, where you will be able to find code and see the result of the code:

                <iframe class="code" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/7z02a8cj/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
            </p>
            <p>
                When I will be describing the code examples it looks like below:
            </p>
            <p>
                For <b>javaScript</b> files:

                <pre class="brush: js">
                    document.write("This is example of js code!")
                </pre>
                For <b>C#</b> files:
                <pre class="brush: csharp">
                    // Matik.cs
                    public class Matik
                    {
                       public static void Main()
                       {
                          System.Console.WriteLine("This is example of C# code!");
                       }
                    }
                </pre>
                For <b>css</b> files:
                <pre class="brush: css">
                     .matik {
                        background-color: white;
                    }
                </pre>
                <!-- Finally, to actually run the highlighter, you need to include this JS on your page -->
                <script type="text/javascript">
                    SyntaxHighlighter.all()
                </script>
            </p>
            <p>
                I think that for now is everything :)
